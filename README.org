** Topic 01
- *Activity 1*
  + Are your ideas about assessment the same now?\\
    After learning the content this week and reading the provided
    article, I now agree with "Assessment Identity Is Dynamic and Multidimensional"
    and it always evolves and is influenced by personal
    experiences. Professional context and other factors.

    The Assessment is a sociocultural and contextual activity. It is a
    technical process and deeply influenced by curriculum expectations
    and community values. The assignment shapes and is shaped by the
    identities of both learners and teachers.

    We believe that assessment is more than measurement now. It is a
    process for determining what students know and can do, and what
    they can achieve.
    The assessment serves multiple purposes, such as formative and
    summative. 
  + Do you think that assessment has the same purpose and intentions
    as it did back then?\\
    No, as the paper convincingly argues, the purpose and intentions of assessment are now understood to be far more complex, personal, and deeply integrated into the very fabric of teaching and learning than they were in the past. The focus has shifted from merely what teachers know how to do to who they are as assessors.
    
  + To what extent have your attitudes to assessment changed since
    becoming an educator?\\ 
    From this study, the change could be deep and comprehensive. It is
    not only that I've added new techniques to my existing toolkit. My key beliefs about the purpose of assessment (from auditing to guiding), my role within it (from judge to coach), and my understanding of its impact (from academic to ontological, affecting student identity) have all been radically reshaped by experience, reflection, and engaging with the exact kind of research presented in this paper.

    My attitude is now less about "How do I test well?" and more about "How does assessment help us all grow?"
  + Do you believe your attitude is influenced by your own experience?\\
    Yes, my attitude is deeply influenced by experience since I first
    started teaching in 2008. My initial view of assessment was narrow
    and heavily influenced by my own experiences as a student. Now, I see assessment as the engine of learning, not just the finish line. 

  + What other elements may influence your beliefs about assessment?\\
    Here are some other elements:
    1. The university culture "To be what you want to be"
    2. Ongoing Learning and Professional Development
    3. The improvement of my understanding of L&T philosophy.

- *Activity 2* \\
  *Reflecting on your own assessment practices in your unit, develop
  an infographic that provides information for students around
  academic integrity. * My area is networking, see below: (some ideas were generated and optimised by ChatGPT 5 on 10th October, 2025)

  They’re not the same; the ideas overlap, but the words, structure,
  and emphases differ. The provided output reads like a classic overview with five components (clarification, probing assumptions, exploring perspectives, examining evidence, challenging conclusions) followed by practical strategies (active listening, open-ended questions, safety, patience, modelling). It’s explanatory and linear, with a formal tone and traditional definitions. 

  The provided input was entered into ChatGPT 3.

  My essay is more operational. It adds distinct sections—core principles, six “question families,” a step-by-step loop, multiple domain examples (teaching, coaching, self-reflection), common pitfalls with fixes, ethical cautions, a mini script, and a practice plan. It prioritises actionable prompts (“What would move you one point on a 0–10 scale?”), implications testing, counterexamples, and synthesis.

  Overlap: both centre on clarifying terms, surfacing assumptions, and
  grounding claims in evidence. Differences: mine broadens categories
  (e.g., testing implications, questioning the question), shifts
  toward behaviuor change and experiments, and uses more
  conversational, coaching-style language. In sum, the same methodology;
  different articulation and application focus.

  *Have a think about how students might be able to use AI to cheat
  your assessment and make a comment in your portfolio.* \\

  *Response:* \\
    In COIT11238 Networked Infrastructure Foundations, multiple-choice
    Quizzes may be vulnerable to integrity issues, as students can use
    AI tools to generate answers with minimal personal effort.
    Likewise, for the final written assessment, students could rely on
    ChatGPT to design a basic network and perform packet-capture
    analysis.

  To mitigate these risks, the portfolio task emphasises
    hands-on practice and lab exercises using a physical network
    devices. Students must document their process with screenshots and
    photographs of tutorial activities and lab work, which
    substantially reduces the impact of AI tools. 

  
  
  

** Topic 03
- *Activity 4* \\
  In the unit CIT11238, we have redeveloped an assessment task,
  a portfolio including tutorial questions and lab exercises. 
  + … assessment is used to engage students in learning that is
   productive. \\
   Best practice in this unit is to design lab exercises that utilise
   physical network devices to engage students in learning.
    This assessment is recognised as a learning activity by hands-on
    network devices. 
  + … feedback is used to actively improve student learning.\\
    We designed two in-class activities to provide feedback for
    actively improving student learning.
  + … students and teachers become responsible partners in learning
   and assessment. \\
   There are two or three versions of the portfolio tasks. The first one is used for checking purposes; the second one is used for feedback to improve, and the last one is used to share the responsibility that reflects the students' and teachers' common efforts in learning and assessment.
  + … students are inducted into the assessment practices and cultures
    of higher education. \\
    A week's lecture is set aside to help students understand how to
    draft a portfolio, utilise lab facilities, and learn teamwork
    within higher education cultures.
    
  + … assessment for learning is placed at the centre of subject and
    program design. \\
    The portfolio tasks, including lab exercises, have 40% allocation,
    and the final written assignment is also derived from this
    assignment. We believe that this type of assessment task has been
    placed at the centre of subject and program design.
    
  + … assessment for learning is a focus for staff and institutional
    development. \\
    We put efforts into developing the lab exercises and those are the
    focus for staff and promote institutional development.
  + … assessment provides an inclusive and trustworthy representation of
    student achievement. \\
    We could see the effectiveness of the capstone project: how the
    students use the knowledge and skills they have learned to build
    their own networks and practice cybersecurity. 

    
** Topic 04
- *Activity 05* \\
  In the unit COIT11238 Networked Infrastructure Foundations, we have
  the following types of assessments (types):
  + Quiz Questions
  + In-Class Activities
  + Portfolios
    + Tutorial Questions
    + Lab exercise
  + Final written assessment.

  In the discipline, we also have some other types of assessment, such
  as teamwork for a provided case study with report and presentation,
  a final exam and so on.

  PS, not sure how to use a table in this platform.

*** Assessment Task 1: 
- Title: Online Quiz
- Weighting: 30%
- Due Date:
  Quiz 1 (15%) is due on Sunday of Week 6; Quiz 2 (15%) is due on Sunday of Week 10. Warning: the quizzes close after the due dates, and no further attempts are allowed.
- Description:
  This assessment item includes two online quizzes: Quiz 1 and Quiz 2.
  The quizzes consist of questions (e.g., multiple-choice, short
  answers). Questions will be drawn from topics in Weeks 1 to 5
  (Quiz 1) and Weeks 6 to 9 (Quiz 2). Complete these Moodle online
  quizzes by the due date. The quizzes automatically close if you have
  not submitted your attempt at a quiz by the due date/time. The
  quizzes will be finalised (automatically submitted) at the due
  date/time. Before the due date. You need to submit each quiz attempt
  to check the results.

  You can attempt the quizzes as many times as you want before the due
  date. However, your last submission for each quiz will be assessed
  as the final result. Please record the details of your submission
  (e.g., the received result, as well as the date and time of your
  submission by taking a screenshot) in case there are any problems
  with your submission to the Moodle system.

  Please note that the questions are selected randomly from a question
  pool, so you will unlikely be asked the same questions each time you
  attempt the quizzes. You will not be able to see your detailed
  feedback on the results until the quiz has closed. To try and submit
  the quiz, your computer must be connected to the Internet, although
  it is possible to save and resume the quiz later. 

  Extensions are not possible for quizzes because the answers will be
  released after the due date of the Quiz. If you miss attempting the
  quizzes, you cannot do them later. 
  

*** Assessment Task 2:
- Title: Portfolio
- Weighting: 40%
- Due Date:
  The first submission is due on Friday of Week 7, and the second submission is due on Friday of Week 11.
- Description:
  The Portfolio assessment requires students to document their weekly tutorial activities and lab exercises throughout the term. This includes screenshots, testing results, reflections, and key learnings. The portfolio is submitted in two parts:

  + Portfolio Part 1 (20%) covers Weeks 3–6 and is due on Friday of
  Week 7.
  + Portfolio Part 2 (20%) covers Weeks 7–10 and is due on Friday of Week 11.

  Each submission must be compiled into a structured document and
  submitted via Moodle. This assessment enables students to
  demonstrate their understanding and practical engagement with the
  unit content[fn:1].

** Topic 06
- *Activity 7*
  In the unit COIT11238, we take the example of moderation for the
  assessment task, portfolio, see below the checklist:
  - [ ] Provide marking guidance
  - [ ] Request 3 marking examples (good, moderate and poor) from each
    marker to check
  - [ ] Feedback with comments and suggestions to make sure the
    marking is based on the provided guidance and aligned to keep to the
    same standard
  - [ ] Randomly check some more samples in the upload marking results
    with the feedback files
  - [ ] Check the academic misconduct cases in Turnitin.
  - [ ] Share the moderation samples as a reference for the coming unit coordinator on the unit Moodle website (hidden). Avoid sharing sensitive data and information. 
  *More details:*
    1. The moderation request will be sent to all markers just after
       the due date of the assessment tasks. (Marking guidance is also
       provided.)

    2. How many times: for example, in the unit COIT11238, the
       moderation is conducted for the portfolio tasks and the final
       written assessment tasks. There are 3 times in total for two
       sub-portfolio tasks and one final written assessment task.

    3. The request for moderation is normally sent to all markers
       through email. We also communicate through MS Teams. And the
       records are kept in emails, MS Teams, as well as in the uni
       computer.

** Topic 07
- *Activity 8*
  Develop two rubrics: one is for teamwork in a spreadsheet and the
  The other is embedded in the Moodle system. See below the screenshots:
  + Rubric 1: Teamwork with individual contribution
     [[./Figure/rubric_1.png]]
  + Rubric 2: Embedded in the Moodle system. 
     [[./Figure/rubric_2.png]]

  \\
  Prefer the first one (Rubric 1, *analytical*), which includes the assessment of individual
  contributions in group work. Designing an assessment rubric for
  group work with individual contributions is crucial for fairness,
  clarity, and meaningful learning. A well-crafted rubric translates
  expectations into visible criteria — such as content quality,
  collaboration, initiative, timeliness, and professional conduct—so
  students know what “good” looks like and how their personal effort
  affects outcomes. It safeguards equity by distinguishing shared
  products from personal impact, reducing free-riding and ensuring
  recognition for leadership, creativity, or behind-the-scenes
  coordination. Rubrics also increase reliability: consistent
  descriptors anchor judgments across markers and projects, making
  grades more defensible and feedback more actionable. When paired
  with self- and peer-evidence (e.g., logs, reflections, peer
  ratings), the rubric triangulates performance to capture process as
  well as product. Pedagogically, it guides students’ attention to
  transferable skills—planning, communication, and
  accountability—while enabling targeted coaching where gaps appear.
  Practically, it streamlines grading, improves transparency, and
  reduces conflict over credit. Most importantly, it signals the
  assessment’s values: collaboration matters, but so does individual
  responsibility. By aligning tasks, behaviours, and evidence, the
  rubric turns group work into a structured learning environment where
  every member understands their role, can monitor progress, and
  receives credible recognition for their unique contribution.

  *Evaluating Three Feedback Modes: Written, Audio, and Video*\\

** Topic 09
- *Activity 10* \\
  Recently, we have been providing feedback on student assessment tasks with
  the following strategies:
  1. direct comments on their work
  2. notes in the feedback marking spreadsheet
  3. A summary posted through a form discussion.
  4. Respond to the students’ email about their assessment.

  Now, we could consider creating videos to explain a common issue in
  the assessment task, or illustrate the practice in a video to show
  how the solution can be achieved with reference and linkage to the
  contents and knowledge in this unit.

  MS Teams can be utilised to improve the students’ feedback, which
  could enhance the communication between teachers and the students,
  even one-to-one or in a private channel, so that the feedback could
  be responded to in an effective way.

 This is an effective way to generate professional quiz questions based on GAI content. It would be helpful for the lecturers to create practice sessions for students quickly, and the quiz questions could be updated in different terms. The pool of questions could be randomly generated for individuals to ensure integrity. I will consider such an effective GAI-based practice in my units.
