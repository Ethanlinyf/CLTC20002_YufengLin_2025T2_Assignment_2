** Topic 01
- Activity 1
  + Are your ideas about assessment the same now?\\
    After learning the content this week and read the provided
    article, now agree with "Assessment Identity Is Dynamic and Multidimensional"
    and it always evolves over time and is inluenced by personal
    experiences. Professional context and other factors.

    The Assessment is a sociocultural and contextual activity. It is a
    technical process and deeply inflencey by crriculum expectations
    and community balues. The assignment shapes and is shaped by the
    identities of both learners and teachers.

    We believe that assessment is more than measurement now. It is a
    process to determine what students know and can do and achieve.
    The assessment serves multiple purposes, such as formative and
    summative. 
  + Do you think that assessment has the same purpose and intentions
    as it did back then?\\
    No, as the the paper convincingly argues, the purpose and intentions of assessment are now understood to be far more complex, personal, and deeply integrated into the very fabric of teaching and learning than they were in the past. The focus has shifted from merely what teachers know how to do to who they are as assessors.
    
  + To what extent have your attitudes to assessment changed since
    becoming an educator?\\ 
    From this study, the change could be deep and comprehensive. It is
    not only that I've added new techniques to my existing toolkit. My key beliefs about the purpose of assessment (from auditing to guiding), my role within it (from judge to coach), and my understanding of its impact (from academic to ontological, affecting student identity) have all been radically reshaped by experience, reflection, and engaging with the exact kind of research presented in this paper.

    My attitude is now less about "How do I test well?" and more about "How does assessment help us all grow?"
  + Do you believe your attitude is influenced by your own experience?\\
    Yes, my attitude is deeply influenced by experience since I first
    started teaching in 2008. My initial view of assessment was narrow
    and heavily influenced by my own experiences as a student. Now, I see assessment as the engine of learning, not just the finish line. 

  + What other elements may influence your beliefs about assessment?\\
    Here are some other elements:
    1. The university culture "To be what you want to be"
    2. Ongoing Learning and professional development
    3. The improvement of my understanding of L&T philosophy.

- *Activity 2* \\
  *Reflecting on your own assessment practices in your unit, develop
  an infographic that provides information for students around
  academic integrity. * My area is networking, see below:

  They’re not the same, the ideas overlap, but the words, structure,
  and emphases differ. The provided output reads like a classic overview with five components (clarification, probing assumptions, exploring perspectives, examining evidence, challenging conclusions) followed by practical strategies (active listening, open-ended questions, safety, patience, modeling). It’s explanatory and linear, with a formal tone and traditional definitions. 

  The provided input was into ChatGPT 3.

  My essay is more operational. It adds distinct sections—core principles, six “question families,” a step-by-step loop, multiple domain examples (teaching, coaching, self-reflection), common pitfalls with fixes, ethical cautions, a mini script, and a practice plan. It prioritizes actionable prompts (“What would move you one point on a 0–10 scale?”), implications testing, counterexamples, and synthesis.

  Overlap: both center on clarifying terms, surfacing assumptions, and grounding claims in evidence. Differences: mine broadens categories (e.g., testing implications, questioning the question), shifts toward behavior change and experiments, and uses more conversational, coaching-style language. In sum, same methodology; different articulation and application focus.

- *Activity 4* \\
  In the unit CIT11238, we have redevelopped an assessment task,
  portfolio including tutorial questions and lab exercises. 
  + … assessment is used to engage students in learning that is
   productive. \\
   Best practice in this unit is to design lab exercises by utilising
   physical network devices to engage students in learning this unit.
    This ssessment is recognised as a learning activity by hand-on
    network devices. 
  + … feedback is used to actively improve student learning.\\
    We designed two in class activities to provide feedback for
    actively improving student learning.
  + … students and teachers become responsible partners in learning
   and assessment. \\
   There are two or three version of the portfolio tasks. First one
   is used for checking purpose; the second one is used for feedback
   to improve and the last one is used to share the responsible that
   reflect the students and teachers common efforts in learning and
   assessment.
  + … students are inducted into the assessment practices and cultures
    of higher education. \\
    A week lecture is set aside to help students understand how to
    draft portfolio, how to utlise the lab facilities and learn the
    teamwork with clutures of higher education.
  + … assessment for learning is placed at the centre of subject and
    program design. \\
    The portfolio tasks including lab exercises have 40% allocation
    and the final written assignment is also derived from this
    assignment. We believe that this type of the assessment task has
    been placed at the center of subject and program design.
  + … assessment for learning is a focus for staff and institutional
    development. \\
    We put efforts to develop the lab exercises and those are the
    focus for staff and promote institutional development.
  + … assessment provides inclusive and trustworthy representation of
    student achievement. \\
    We could see the effectiveness in the capstone project how the
    students use the learned knowledge and skills to build their own
    network and perform cybersecurity practices.

    
** Topic 04
- *Activity 05* \\
  In the unit COIT11238 Networked Infrastructure Foundations, we have
  the following types of the assessment types:
  + Quiz Questions
  + In-Class Activities
  + Portfolios
    + Tutorial Questions
    + Lab exercise
  + Final written assessment.

  In the discipline, we also have some other types of assessment, such
  as teamwork for a provided case study with report and presentation,
  a final exam and so on.

  PS, not sure how to use a table in this platform.

- *Activity 7*
  In the unit COIT11238, we take the example of moderation for the
  assessment task, portfolio, see below the check list:
  - [ ] Provide marking guidance
  - [ ] Requst 3 marking example (good, moderate and poor) from each
    marker to check
  - [ ] Feedback with comments and suggestions to make sure the
    marking based on the provided guidance and aligned to keep on the
    same standard
  - [ ] Random check some more samples in the upload marking results
    with the feedback files
  - [ ] Check the academic misconduct cases in TurnItin.

** Topic 07
- *Activity 8*
  Develop Two rubrics: one is for teamwork in a spreadsheet and the
  other is embedded in Moodle system. See below the screenshots:
  [[./Figure/rubric_1.png]]

  [[./Figure/rubric_2.png]]

  \\
  Prefer the first one, which includes the assessment of individual
  contributions in a group work. Designing an assessment rubric for
  group work with individual contributions is crucial for fairness,
  clarity, and meaningful learning. A well-crafted rubric translates
  expectations into visible criteria — such as content quality, collaboration, initiative, timeliness, and professional conduct—so students know what “good” looks like and how their personal effort affects outcomes. It safeguards equity by distinguishing shared products from personal impact, reducing free-riding and ensuring recognition for leadership, creativity, or behind-the-scenes coordination. Rubrics also increase reliability: consistent descriptors anchor judgments across markers and projects, making grades more defensible and feedback more actionable. When paired with self- and peer-evidence (e.g., logs, reflections, peer ratings), the rubric triangulates performance to capture process as well as product. Pedagogically, it guides students’ attention to transferable skills—planning, communication, and accountability—while enabling targeted coaching where gaps appear. Practically, it streamlines grading, improves transparency, and reduces conflict over credit. Most importantly, it signals the assessment’s values: collaboration matters, but so does individual responsibility. By aligning tasks, behaviors, and evidence, the rubric turns group work into a structured learning environment where every member understands their role, can monitor progress, and receives credible recognition for their unique contribution.

  *Evaluating Three Feedback Modes: Written, Audio, and Video*\\

** Topic 09
- *Activity 10* \\
  Recently, we are providing feedback on student assessment tasks with
  the following strategies:
  1. direct comments on their work
  2. notes in the feedback marking spreadsheet
  3. A summary posted through a form discussion.
  4. Response the students’ email about their assessment.

  Now, we could consider creating videos to explain a common issue in
  the assessment task, or illustrate the practice in a video to show
  how the solution can be achieve with reference and linkage to the
  contents and knowledge in this unit.

  MS Teams can be utilised to improve the students’ feedback, which
  could enhance the communication between teachers and the students,
  even one to one or in a private channel so that the feedback could
  be responded in a effective way.

  This is an effective way to generate quiz questions based on the GAI
  contents, which are professional. It will be helpful for the
  lecturers to create the practices for students in a quick way and
  the quiz questions could be updated in different terms. The pool of
  the questions could be randomly generated for individuals so that
  the integrity could be ensured. I will consider such effective
  GAI-based practice in my units.
